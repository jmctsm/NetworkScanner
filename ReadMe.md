# Network Scanner

## Purpose
The purpose of this is one to help me learn more about Python.  The second is to make something usable and extendable.  As I add some stuff, I can add more to this file.

### Where I am at so far.
So far I have the following:
#### pinger
    uses pythonping to ping a host or subnet
#### port_scanner
    connects to specific ports to see if they reply back
        I have protocol header grabbers for HTTP and HTTPs
        Plan is to add others as time goes on
#### device_class
    class I will use to store all information as I continue writing this app
#### Tests
    I have unit tests for pinger, port_scanner, the class I will use, and the protocol scanners
